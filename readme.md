# Airbitz Javascript core

Run `npm install` to get the dependencies you need,
then run `npm test` to run the tests.

To build for the web, run `npm run webpack`.
This will produce a file, `./abc.js`, which can be used in a `<script>` tag.

All sources are in the [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/).
